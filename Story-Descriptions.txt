Room 1: It's actually a bit eerie how non-descript this room is

Player goes up the stairs: The door locked. You don't have a key.

Room 3 coming from Room 1: You're in what appears to be a new room. There is a door at the other end, and a corner halfway between you and door on the left.
What would you like to do?

Player goes through teleport door in Room 3: Another room! And not the room that you might've thought it would be.

Room 2: You're suddenly in a another room. There's a corner in front of you to the left. You can't see what's beyond it. It could be interesting if you were feeling courageous. But we all that know that that's a stretch.

Player picks up key: It's a key! Well done, you, I'm so proud of you. Did your Dad ever tell you that? No, I didn't think so. You actually picked it up, congratulations! But will you use it?

Player uses key on the door: Oh look, it worked! And now you're back where you started. Progress?
What would you like to do?

Room 4: It is a square (ish), completely blank room. There is rising fog ahead, or is it smoke? There are stairs going down to your left through a person-sized hole in the wall.
What would you like to do?

Player goes towards the fog: As you go towards the fog, you feel slight breeze brush against your face. Is this it, have you found where you can escape? Perhaps, but you can't see through the fog. You reach the edge of the room, there is a ledge.
What would you like to do?
            1: Jump into the fog from where you are. Hope you know the laws physics reaaally well.
            2: Looking behind you, you could back to the hallways before this room, and do a running jump. The laws of physics would certainly be more in your favour.
            3: You don't want to die, take the stairs.
            4: Do nothing. Contemplate your life choices.

Player picks 1:  
                1: You try to get across from a standing jump without knowing where you're going. Bad life choice? Yes. You don't jump anywhere near far enough. If there was anything there, you haven't reached it. You scream as you fall and die.
                2: (Other description of Room 10) Apparently a standing jump was enough! You look around as you breathe heavily. The room as as large as the last one. It angles into a door-less opening directly opposite you.
What would you like to do?

Player picks 2: You walk back into the hallway. You are the furthest you can from the fog, it's now or never. You start running.
              1: Oof. The run up still wasn't enough. You don't jump anywhere near far enough. If there was anything there, you haven't reached it. You scream as you fall and die.
              2: The run up was a success! You look around as you breathe heavily. The room as as large as the last one. It angles into a door-less opening directly opposite you.
What would you like to do?
                1: Jump back across, you know how far it is now. Have fun?
                  1: Another standing jump. -> A bigger snail reaches up through the fog and eats you. That'll teach you.
                  2: Another running jump.
                    1: A bigger snail reaches up through the fog and eats you. That'll teach you.
                    2: There was snail goop on the ground that you didn't notice before. You slip on it as you run, fall into the ravene and die. The snail eats your corpse.
                2: Go through the opening on the other side of the room. -> Room 9 (in reverse)
              3: There was snail goop on the ground that you didn't notice before. You slip on it as you run, and die. The snail eats your corpse.
Room 4 (in reverse): You've been here before. Silly billy, are you going around in circles? There is fog to your left, and a opening to your right.

Player reaches the t-junction of Room 5 moving forwards: 
You are at a crossroads. (I mean, it's actually a T-Junction, but crossroads sounds cooler, y'know?) You can see a dark room with no door to your left, and a well-lit one to your right. One could lead to your salvation, the other could lead to your doom, or both, or neither. I trust you know which is which?
            1: The dark room. It matches your soul.
            2: The bright room. Feeling happy are you? We'll fix that.
Player reaches the junction of Room 5 moving backwards: 
A very thin, long hallway. You can see a corner to your right, and a room shrouded in darkness directly ahead of you. The darkness seems to enamate from the room, and pull in. One way could lead to your salvation, the other could lead to your doom, or both, or neither. I trust you know which is which?
            1: Go around the corner to the left. -> Another corner. What would you like to do?
                                                      1: Tempt fate, forward around the corner. -> You see a long flight of stairs. You can only just see the light at the top.
                                                                                                      1. "forward" -> Room 4 (in reverse)
                                                                                                      2. "back" -> Room 5
                                                      2: Too risky for me, go back, scaredy-cat. -> Room 5

            2: Forward to the ROOM OF DARKNESS. -> Room 6

Room 6: There is nothing. There is only pitch black. You have entered a room that is so blank, it appears to be a black void. The void seems to draw you in, it calls to you, it makes you feel welcome, you feel like nothing could stop you -- just kidding! You got lost in a trance. The snail finds you and eats you.

Room 7: This is a very large room. It is well lit. It feels almost like you've finally escaped, like you've reached the end, and yet, you haven't. There is only an opening to your right, will you take it?
Room 7 (in reverse): This is a very large room. It is well lit. There is only an opening to your left, will you take it?

Room 8: You are in a hallway. There is a ladder ahead of you. More darkness creeps down over the ladder, preventing you from seeing where it goes. Could the snail be at the top waiting for you? There's only one way to find out.
Room 8 (in reverse): At the bottom of the 

Room 9: Another hallway. Smaller though, than the one at the bottom of the ladder. To your left, a door, no different than any other that you've encountered. To your right, an opening, leading to a large room. Both look inviting. What would you like to do?
            1: "right" -> Room 10
            2: "forward" -> Player wins
Room 9 (in reverse): It is a hallway. There is a ledge to your right, and a corner to your left. What's around the corner, what's over the ledge?
              1: Look over the ledge.
                There is a ladder. The bottom is shrouded in darkness. Do you dare?
                  1. Go down the ladder. -> Room 8 (in reverse)
                  2. Back to the big room. -> Room 10
                  3. Nope, nope. Try the door. -> Player wins 
              2: Back to the big room. -> Room 10
              3: Try the door? -> Player wins

Room 10: At least you haven't been eaten, yet. You feel a slight breeze caress your legs, and there's fog ahead. Are you near, or are you even further away? The room has an interesting shape, there are angles leading back to the opening you just came from, but there are no other doors.
            1: "back" -> Room 9 (in reverse)
            2: "forward" -> The fog... is fog. It's very... foggy? If there is anything there, you can't see it. What would you like to do?
                              1: Jump into the fog from where you are. Hope you know the laws physics reaaally well.
                                1: You try to get across from a standing jump without knowing where you're going. Bad life choice? Yes. You don't jump anywhere near far enough. If there was anything there, you haven't reached it. You scream as you fall and die.
                                2: (Other description of Room 10) Apparently a standing jump was enough! You look around as you breathe heavily. The room as as large as the last one. It angles into a door-less opening directly opposite you.

                                    1: Jump back across, you know how far it is now. Have fun?
                                      1: Another standing jump. -> A bigger snail reaches up through the fog and eats you. That'll teach you.
                                    2: Another running jump.
                                      1: A bigger snail reaches up through the fog and eats you. That'll teach you.
                                      2: There was snail goop on the ground that you didn't notice before. You slip on it as you run, fall into the ravene and die. The snail eats your corpse.

                                2: The run up was a success! You look around as you breathe heavily. You've seen this room before, but from the other direction. The stairs you took are now on your right. Was that truly a wise choice?
                                  What would you like to do?
                                    1: "right" -> Room 5
                                    2: "forward" -> Room 3 (in reverse)
                              3: Naaah, let's go back. -> Room 9 (in reverse)
                              4: Do nothing. Contemplate your life choices. -> The snail finds you and eats you.

Player wins!
