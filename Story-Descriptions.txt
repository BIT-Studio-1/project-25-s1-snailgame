Room 1: It's actually a bit eerie how non-descript this room is

Player goes up the stairs: The door locked. You don't have a key.

Room 3 coming from Room 1: You're in a new room. There is a door at the other end, and a corner halfway between you and door on the left.

Player uses key on the door: Oh look, it worked! And now you're back where you started. Progress?
What would you like to do?
