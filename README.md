Studio Rules:
1) progress == usable software
2) Only write code that everyone can understand
3) always discuss with your team before you make any change to the code / don't muck with other people's bits without asking
4) iterate
5) one feature finished is better than a bunch not
6) make the simplest possible version then add incremental improvements
7) do individual dev work outside of class / Do your homework

8) 10(ish) commits per week per person
